# My Arduino Learning Journey
---------------------------------

About This Project

This repository documents my journey learning Arduino, hardware programming, and embedded systems.
I’m combining my computer science background with hands-on electronics to explore how software interacts with the physical world.  
This project will grow from simple LED circuits to more advanced IoT-style automation and sensor systems.

🗓️ Progress Log

Lesson 1 – Setting up and programming the Arduino
Date: Nov 10, 2025  

Notes:
-  Plugged in the Arduino to my Mac for the first time!
-  Arduino IDE is used to send commands to the arduino.
-  Every Arduino program has void setup() and void loop()
-  HIGH means on and LOW means off.

Summary: Arduino is a circuit board that connects to your computer. You can write code to 
make it do different things like blinking leds. The basic ino file has a void setup function and a void loop
function. set up is to activate the pins and loop is to control the pin.  

Homework:
-  Make pin13 LED blink as fast as possible [COMPLETED]

----------------------

Lesson 2 – Understanding how LEDs Work.
Date: Nov 13, 2025

Notes: 
-  Light bulb works by taking a wire and heating it up with voltage. 
(Not effiecient because it generates more heat than light)
-  Semi Conductors are important part of electronics can both conduct and insulate.
-  N-Type when you put donor impurites in Conduction band
-  P-Type when you put acceptor impurites in Valence band
-  N-Type and P-Type together cause the electrons to collide and release photons with positive and Negative voltage
-  Long leg positive voltage Short Leg negative voltage

Summary: LEDs work by photons and electrictity. 

----------------------

Lesson 3 - Understanding how Breadboards work.
Date: Nov 15, 2025

Notes: 
- Circuit diagrams 
- Protyping board/ Breadboard - used to make circuit diagrams in a neat way.
- Holes along column are connected | Rows are not connected | top and bottom rows are all connected
- Built first circuit! Using LEDs, Resistors, wires and breadboard.

Summary:
Breadboards can be used to connect and create all sorts of exciting circuits!

Homework:
Control 3 different types of LEDs with the breadboard. blink red led 5 times, 
green led 10 times and blue led 15 times. [COMPLETED]

----------------------

Lesson 4 - Understanding Arduino Variables

Notes:
- variables are like c++ variables.
- variables are used to make code less complex.
Summary:
Variables are useful to make coding less complex incase you need to change things.

Homework: Red LED 5 times fast green LED 10 times slow blue LED 15 times really slow [COMPLETED]

-----------------------

Lesson 5 - Understanding and working with Binary Numbers

Notes: 
Recap - Semiconductors can be Conductors and Insulators. can be switched by applying voltage.
ON = 1
OFF = 0


Summary: Binary is what computers use to perform calculations.

Homework: Make a binary led counter.

-----------------------

Lesson 6 - binary counter follow along
HW - create 5 bit binary counter


## 🧪 Mini Projects (Planned)
- [ ] Blink an LED using Python  
- [ ] Toggle LED with a button  
- [ ] Temperature sensor monitor  
- [ ] Motion-activated light  
- [ ] Mini smart home control system

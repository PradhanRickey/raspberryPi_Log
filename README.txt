# My Arduino Learning Journey
---------------------------------

About This Project

This repository documents my journey learning Arduino, hardware programming, and embedded systems.
I’m combining my computer science background with hands-on electronics to explore how software interacts with the physical world.  
This project will grow from simple LED circuits to more advanced IoT-style automation and sensor systems.

🗓️ Progress Log

Lesson 1 – Setting up and programming the Arduino
Date: Nov 10, 2025  

-  Plugged in the Arduino to my Mac for the first time!
-  Downloaded the Arduino IDE 
-  Every Arduino program has void setup() and void loop()
-  Wrote first code to turn on and off Orange Led connected to pin 13 with HIGH and LOW parameters

Summary: Arduino is a circuit board that connects to your computer. You can write code to 
make it do different things like blinking leds. The basic ino file has a void setup function and a void loop
function. set up is to activate the pins and loop is to control the pin.  

Homework:
-  Make pin13 LED blink as fast as possible [COMPLETED]

Next: Understanding how LEDs Work.
